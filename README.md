    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

3.  **Set up your Firebase configuration:**
      * Create a project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
      * Add a new web app to your project.
      * In your project settings, find your Firebase SDK snippet (select "Config").
      * Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory.
      * Add your Firebase configuration keys to the `.env` file like this:
        ```env
        VITE_API_KEY="AIzaSy..."
        VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project-id.firebaseapp.com"

## üî• Firestore Security Rules

For the application to function securely, you must set up Firestore Security Rules. Go to your Firebase project's **Firestore Database \> Rules** tab and paste the following:

```
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    match /tales/{taleId} {
      // A user can create a tale if they are logged in and the tale's UID matches their own.
      allow create: if request.auth != null &&
                      request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uid;

      // A user can read, update, or delete a tale if they are logged in and are the owner.
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null &&
                                  request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
    }
  }
}
```
